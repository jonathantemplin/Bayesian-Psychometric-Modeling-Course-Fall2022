## Latent Traits: A Big-Picture View

Latent trait theory posits there are attributes of a person (typically) that are:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* Unobservable (hence the term latent)
* Quantifiable 
* Related to tasks that can be observed
::: 

Often, these attributes are often called constructs, underscoring they are constructed and do not exist, such as:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* A general or specific ability (in educational contexts)
* A feature of personality, such as "extroversion" (in psychological contexts)
::: 

The same psychometric models apply regardless of the measurement context (math don't care)

## The Long History of Latent Trait Theory

* Latent trait theory, as we now know it, began well before most current academic disciplines
  * Educational assessments (tests) have existed for centuries
    * These seek to measure latent abilities 
  * The study of intelligence began in the mid 1800s
    * Intelligence is also a latent trait
* Methodological innovations have often spurred empirical (discipline-specific) trait development
  * Early methods were limited by mathematical and statistical theory
  * The invention and wide-spread use of computers made advances in psychometrics possible
  * More recent statistical innovations further shape methods (i.e., computational estimation methods using Bayes)

## Latent Traits are Interdisciplinary

* Many varying fields use some version of latent traits
* Similar (or identical) methods are often developed separately
  * Item response theory in education
  * Item factor analysis in psychology
* Many different terms for same ideas, such as the 
  * Label given to the latent trait: Factor/Ability/Attribute/Construct
  * Label given to those giving the data: Examinee/Subject/Participant/Respondent/Patient/Student
* What this means:
  * Lots of words to keep track of, but (relatively) few concepts
  * We will focus on concepts (but have a lot of words)

## The Best Constructs Are Built Purposefully

* Latent constructs seldom occur randomly---they are defined 
  * The definition typically indicates:
    * What the construct means
    * What observable behaviors are likely related to the construct
      * For a lot of what we do, observable behavior means answering questions on an assessment or survey
* Therefore, modern psychometric methods are built around specifying the set of observed variables to which a latent variable relates 
  * <u>No need for exploratory analyses---we define our construct and seek to falsify our definition</u>
* The term I use for "relates" is "measure"
  * Educational assessment items measure some type of ability

## Guiding Principles

* To better understand psychometric methods and theory, I recommend you envision what you would do if latent variables were not latent
  * Example: Imagine if we could directly observe mathematics ability 
* Then, consider what we would do with that value
  * Example: We could predict how students would perform on items using logistic regression
* Psychometric models essentially do this---use observed variable methods as if we know the value of the latent variable
  * There are some catches, though
    * We need a data collection design that allows for such methods to be used
    * We need a more formal vetting of whether or not we did a good job measuring the construct

## Measurement, Formally Defined

Measurement is the quantification of some characteristic (physical or otherwise)

* Consider the measurement of length (a physical construct)
  * Why? We need to know where to put things
  * How? We use some type of device (a ruler, yardstick, tape measure) and note the distance from the origin
  * What? The distance is then quantified with some type of unit (a unit of measure)
    * Inches, centimeters, meters, yards, etc...

## Measurement of Latent Constructs

* How does this differ when we cannot observe the thing we are measuring---when the construct is latent?
  * We still need something we can observe---item responses for example
  * We need a method to map the response to a number (like the inches)
    * Strongly agree==5?
  * We also need a way to aggregate all responses to a value that represents a person
    * A score or classification
  * We then need a way to ensure what we just did means what we think it does
    * Methods for validation
  * We also need to remember that the values we estimate for the latent variable won't be perfectly reliable  
    * Caution needed for secondary analyses
  
## Measurement Models

* A distinguishing feature of psychometric models is the second word---they are models
* We often call such models "measurement models"
* Measurement models are the mathematical specification that provides the link between the latent variable(s) and the observed data
* The form of such models looks different across the wide classes of measurement models (e.g., factor analysis vs. item response models) but wide generalities exist
* Measurement models need:
  * Distributional assumptions about the data (with link functions)
  * A linear or non-linear form that predicts data from the trait(s)
* The key: Observed data are being predicted by latent variable(s)

## Measurement Models vs. Other Measurement Techniques

Measurement models are a different way of thinking about psychometrics than what most people without psychometric training do

* A lot of the world will enumerate item response scores 
  * e.g., correct response == 1; strongly agree == 5
* The latent trait score estimate is then formed by adding the response scores together
  * The "Add Stuff* Up" model
    * Please see <a href="https://lesahoffman.com" target="_blank">Lesa Hoffman</a> for a more explicit definition of Stuff
* As it turns out, the na√Øve adding together of item scores implies a measurement model
  * Called parallel items --- very strict assumptions (equal variances and covariances)

## 

<h1>Characteristics of Latent Variables</h1>

## Characteristics of Latent Variables
  
* Latent variables can have different levels of measurement (in concept, not in practice)
  * Interval level (as in factor analysis and item response theory) --- Continuous
    * No absolute zero, but units of the quantity are equivalent across the range of values
    * Example: A person with a value of 2 is the same distance from a person with a value of 0 as is a person with a value of -2
  * Ordinal level (as in diagnostic classification models)
    * Can rank order people but not determine how far apart they may be
    * Example: Students considered masters of a topic have more ability than students considered non-masters
  * Nominal level (as in latent class or finite mixture models) --- Categorical
    * Groups/classes/clusters of people
    * No scale provided at all
    
## Most Common: Continuous Latents

* For most of this class, we will treat latent variables as continuous (interval level)
* As they do not exist, continuous latent variables need a defined metric:
  * What is their mean?
  * What is their standard deviation?
* Defining the metric is the first step in a latent variable model
  * Called scale identification
* The metric is arbitrary
  * Can set differing means/variances but still have same model
  * Linear transformations of parameters based on scale mean and standard deviation

## Measurement Model Path Diagrams

Measurement models are often depicted in graphical format, using what is called a path diagram

::: {.nonincremental} 
* Typically, latent variables are represented as objects that are circles/ovals
* Using graph theory terms, a variable in a path diagram (latent or observed) is called a node
* Lines connecting the variables are called edges
:::

## Latent Variable Only
<center>
```{r firstLatent}
if (!require(pathdiagram)) install.packages("pathdiagram")
wall()

latentVariable = latent("Latent Variable", rx= .2, ry=.2)
draw(latentVariable)
```
</center>

## Adding Observed Variables

Measurement model path diagrams often denote observed variables with boxes

On the next slide:

* The term "latent variable" is replaced with $\theta$
* The observed variables are denoted as $Y1$ through $Y5$ 
  * Imagine these represent the five items of the scale we started class with


## Path Diagram with Observed and Latent Variables

<center>
```{r ObsLatent}
if (!require(pathdiagram)) install.packages("pathdiagram")
wall(ylim=c(.2,1))

latentVariable = latent(expression(theta), rx= .12, ry=.12, x=.8, y = .6)
draw(latentVariable)
obsVariables = list()
for (var in 1:5){
  obsVariables[[paste0("Y", var)]] = manifest(paste0("Y", var), x = .2 , y=.9-(var-1)*.15) 
  draw(obsVariables[[paste0("Y", var)]])
  arrow(from=latentVariable, to = obsVariables[[paste0("Y", var)]], start = "west", end="east")
}


```
</center>

## Path Diagrams: Not Models

Path diagrams are useful for depicting a measurement model but are not models

* All model parameters cannot be included in the diagram
* No indication about the distribution of the variables (especially needed in Bayesian psychometric modeling)

## Translating a Path Diagram to a Model

Going back to our the point from before---let's imagine the latent variable as an observed variable

::: {.nonincremental} 
* An arrow (edge) indicates one variable predicts another
  * The predictor is the variable on the side of the arrow without the point
  * The outcome is the variable on the side of the point
* If we assume the items were continuous (like linear regression), the diagram indicates a regression model for each outcome
:::

$$
\begin{array}{c}
Y_{p1} = \beta_{Y_1, 0} + \beta_{Y_1,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_1} \\ 
\end{array}
$$

## Interpreting the Parameters

All five regression lines implied by the model are then:
$$
\begin{array}{c}
Y_{p1} = \beta_{Y_1, 0} + \beta_{Y_1,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_1} \\ 
Y_{p1} = \beta_{Y_2, 0} + \beta_{Y_2,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_2} \\ 
Y_{p3} = \beta_{Y_3, 0} + \beta_{Y_3,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_3} \\ 
Y_{p4} = \beta_{Y_4, 0} + \beta_{Y_4,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_4} \\ 
Y_{p5} = \beta_{Y_5, 0} + \beta_{Y_5,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_5} \\ 
\end{array}
$$

Here:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* $\beta_{Y_i, 0}$ is the intercept of the regression line predicting the score from item $Y_i$
  * The expected resposne score for a person who has $\theta_p=0$
* $\beta_{Y_i, 1}$ is the slope of the regression line predicting the score from item $Y_i$
  * The expected change in the response score for a one-unit change in $\theta_p$
:::

## More Interpreting the Parameters

Also:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* $e_{p, Y_i}$ is the residual (error), indicating the difference in the predicted score for person $p$ to item $i$
  * Like in regression, we additionally assume:
    * $e_{p,Y_i} \sim N\left(0, \sigma^2_{e_{Y_i}} \right)$: is normally distributed with mean zero and...
* $\sigma^2_{e_{Y_i}}$ is the residual variance of item $Y_i$, indicating the square of how far off the prediction is on average
:::

The five regression models are estimated simultaneously:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* If $\theta_p$ were observed, we would call this a multivariate regression
  * <u>Multivariate regression</u>: Multiple continuous outcomes predicted by one or more predictors
:::

## More About Regression

$$Y_{pi} = \beta_{Y_i, 0} + \beta_{Y_i,1} \theta_p + e_{p, Y_i} $$
In the regression model for a single variable, what distribution do we assume about the outcome?

* As error is normally distributed, the outcome takes a normal distribution $Y_{pi} \sim N( ?, ?)$
* As $\beta_{Y_i, 0}$, $\beta_{Y_i,1}$, and $\theta_p$ are constants, they move the mean of the outcome to $\beta_{Y_i, 0} + \beta_{Y_i,1} \theta_p$
  * $Y_{pi} \sim N( \beta_{Y_i, 0} + \beta_{Y_i,1} \theta_p, ?)$
* As error has a variance of $\sigma^2_{e_{Y_i}}$, the outcome is assumed to have variance $\sigma^2_{e_{Y_i}}$
  * $Y_{pi} \sim N( \beta_{Y_i, 0} + \beta_{Y_i,1} \theta_p, \sigma^2_{e_{Y_i}})$
* Therefore, we say $Y_{pi}$ follows a conditionally normal distribution

## The Univariate Normal (Gaussian) Distribution

* When we say $Y \sim N( \mu, \sigma^2)$, that implies a probability density function (pdf).
* For the univariate normal (sometimes called Gaussian) distribution, the pdf is: $$f\left(Y\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2 }}\exp\left[\frac{\left(Y - \mu \right)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right]$$
* Here, $\pi$ is the constant 3.14 and $\exp$ is Euler's constant (2.71)
* Of note here is that there are three components that go into the function:
  * The data $Y$
  * The mean $\mu$ --- this can be the conditional mean we had on the previous slide (formed by parameters)
  * The variance $\sigma^2$
* <u>The key to using Bayesian methods is to know the distributions for each of the variables in the model</u>

## From Regression to CFA

When $\theta_i$ is latent, the five-variable model becomes a <u>confirmatory factor analysis</u> (CFA) model 

::: {.nonincremental} 
* <u>CFA</u>: Prediction of continuous items using linear regression with one or more continuous latent variables as predictors
  * The interpretations of the regression parameters are identical between linear regression and CFA
::: 

## Regression and CFA Differences 

The differences between CFA and regression are:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* $\theta_p$ is not observed in CFA but is observed in regression
  * Therefore, we must set its mean and variance
    * There are multiple was to do this (standardized factor, marker item, etc...)---stay tuned
* Each of the model parameters has a different name (and symbol denoting it) in CFA
  * $\beta_{Y_i, 0} = \mu_i$  is the item intercept
  * $\beta_{Y_i,1} = \lambda_i$ is the factor loading for an item
  * $\sigma^2_{e_{Y_i}} = \psi^2_i$ is the unique variance for an item
* We must have a sufficient number of observed variables to empirically identify the latent trait
::: 

## Changing Notation

Our five-item CFA model with CFA-notation:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
Y_{p1} = \mu_1 + \lambda_1 \theta_p + e_{p, Y_1} \\ 
Y_{p2} = \mu_2 + \lambda_2 \theta_p  + e_{p, Y_2} \\ 
Y_{p3} = \mu_3 + \lambda_3 \theta_p  + e_{p, Y_3} \\ 
Y_{p4} = \mu_4 + \lambda_4 \theta_p  + e_{p, Y_4} \\ 
Y_{p5} = \mu_5 + \lambda_5 \theta_p  + e_{p, Y_5} \\ 
\end{array}
$$

<h1>Measurement Models for Different Item Types </h1>

## Measurement Models for Different Item Types

* The CFA model assumes (1) continuous latent variables and (2) continuous item scores
  * What should we do if we have binary items (e.g., yes/no, correct/incorrect)?
* If we had observed $\theta_p$ and wanted to predict $Y_{1p} \in \{0,1\}$ (read as $Y_{p1}$ takes values of either zero or one) what type of analysis would we use?
* Logistic regression: 
  $$P\left(Y_{p1} = 1\right) = \frac{\exp \left( \beta_{Y_1,0} + \beta_{Y_1,1} \theta_p\right)}{1+\exp \left( \beta_{Y_1,0} + \beta_{Y_1,1} \theta_p\right)}$$  
* Alternatively: $$Logit \left( P\left(Y_{p1} = 1\right) \right) = \beta_{Y_1,0} + \beta_{Y_1,1} \theta_p$$

## Interpreting of Model Parameters

$$Logit \left( P\left(Y_{p1} = 1\right) \right) = \beta_{Y_1,0} + \beta_{Y_1,1} \theta_p$$

Here:

::: {.nonincremental} 
- $\beta_{Y_1,0}$ is the intercept --- the expected log odds of a correct response when $\theta_p = 0$
- $\beta_{Y_1,1}$ is the slope --- the expected change in log odds of a correct response for a one-unit change in $\theta_p$
- Note: there is no error variacne term...why?
:::

## Bernoulli Distributions

* Using logistic regression for binary outcomes makes the assumption that the outcome follows a (conditional) Bernoulli distribution, or $Y \sim B(p_Y)$
  * The parameter $p_Y$ is the probability that Y equals one, or $P\left(Y = 1\right)$
* The Bernoulli pdf (sometimes called the probability mass function as the variable is discrete) is: $$f(Y) = \left(p_Y\right)^Y \left(1-p_y \right)^{1-Y}$$
* So, there is no error variance parameter in logistic regression as there is no parameter in the distribution that represents error.
  * Error is represented by how far off a probability is from either zero or one

## Logistic Regression with Latent Variable(s)

::: {.nonincremental} 
* Back to our running example, if we had binary items and wished to form a (unidimensional) latent variable model, we would have something that looked like: 

$$P\left(Y_{pi} = 1 \mid \theta_p \right) = \frac{\exp \left( \mu_i + \lambda_i \theta_p\right)}{1+\exp \left( mu_i + \lambda_i \theta_p\right)}$$  
* Here, the parameters retain their names from CFA:
  * $\beta_{Y_i, 0} = \mu_i$  is the item intercept
  * $\beta_{Y_i,1} = \lambda_i$ is the factor loading for an item
* We call this slope-intercept parameterization
* This parameterization is called <u>item factor analysis(IFA)</u> 
:::

## From IFA to IRT

::: {.nonincremental}
* IFA and IRT are equivalent models---their parameters are transformations of each other:
$$ 
\begin{array}{c}
a_i = \lambda_i \\
b_i = -\frac{\mu_i}{\lambda_i}
\end{array}
$$
* This yields the discrimination-difficulty parameterization that is common in unidimensional IRT models:

$$P\left(Y_{pi} = 1 \mid \theta_p \right) = \frac{\exp \left( a_i\left( \theta_p -b_i\right)\right)}{1+\exp \left(a_i\left( \theta_p -b_i\right)\right)}$$
  * $b_i$ is the item difficulty---the point on the $\theta$ scale at which a person has a 50% chance of answering with a one
  * $a_i$ is the item discrimination---the slope of a line tangent to the curve at the item difficulty
* IRT models have a number of different forms of this equation (this is the two-parameter logistic 2PL model)
:::

## Generalized Linear (Psychometric) Models

:::{.nonincremental}
* A key to understanding the varying types of psychometric models is that they must map the theory (the right-hand side of the equation---$\theta_p$) to the type of observed data 
* Today we've seen two types of data: continuous (with a normal distribution) and binary (with a Bernoulli distribution)
* For each, the right-hand side of the item model was the same
* For the normal distribution:
  * We had an error term but did not transform the right-hand side
* For the Bernoulli distribution:
  * No error term and a function used to transform the right-hand side so that the conditional mean ranged between zero and one
* We will use these features in each of our models as we continue in this class
  * This is also an introduction to generalized linear models
:::

## Wrapping Up

:::{.nonincremental}
* This lecture was a quick introduction to psychometric models
* Latent trait theory guides the construction of items
* Psychometric models then implement and test the theory
* The family of model used is determined by the type of observable data
