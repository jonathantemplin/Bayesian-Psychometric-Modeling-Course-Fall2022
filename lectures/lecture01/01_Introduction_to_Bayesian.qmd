## Class Discussion: What is Bayesian?


## Bayesian from Birth

## The Basics of Bayesian Analyses

* Bayesian statistical analysis refers to the use of models where some or all of the parameters are treated as random components
  * Each parameter comes from some type of distribution
* The likelihood function of the data is then augmented with an additional term that represents the likelihood of the prior distribution for each parameter
  * Think of this as saying each parameter has a certain likelihood – the height of the prior distribution
* The final estimates are then considered summaries of the posterior distribution of the parameter, conditional on the data
  * In practice, we use these estimates to make inferences, just as is done when using non-Bayesian approaches (e.g., maximum likelihood/least squares)

## Why are Bayesian Methods Used?

* Bayesian methods get used because of the *relative* accessibility of one method of estimation (MCMC – to be discussed shortly)

* There are four main reasons why people use MCMC:

1. Missing data
2. Lack of software capable of handling large sized analyses
3. New models/generalizations of models not available in software
4. Philosoplyical Reasons (e.g., membership in the cult of Bayes)

## Perceptions and Issues with Bayesian Methods

* The use of Bayesian statistics has been controversial, historically (but less so today)
  * The use of certain prior distributions can produce results that are biased or reflect subjective judgment rather than objective science
* Most MCMC estimation methods are computationally intensive
  * Until very recently, very few methods available for those who aren’t into programming in Fortran, C, or C++
* Understanding of what Bayesian methods had been very limited outside the field of mathematical statistics (but that is changing now)
* Over the past 20 years, Bayesian methods have become widespread – making new models estimable and becoming standard in some social science fields (quantitative psychology and educational measurement)

## How Bayesian Statistics Work

<!-- ::: {.nonincremental} -->
Bayesian methods rely on Bayes’ Theorem
<!-- :::  -->

$$P (A \mid B) = \frac{P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} \propto P(B\mid A)P(A)$$
Here:

::: {.nonincremental} 
* $P(A)$ is the <u>prior distribution</u> (pdf) of A (i.e., WHY THINGS ARE BAYESIAN)
* $P(B)$ is the <u>marginal distribution</u> (pdf) of B
* $P(B \mid A)$ is the <u>conditional distribution</u> (pdf) of B, given A
* $P (A \mid B)$is the <u>posterior distribution</u> (pdf) of A, given B

:::

## A Live Bayesian Example

* Suppose we wanted to assess the probability of rolling a one on a six-sided die: $$p_1 = P(D=1)$$

* We then collect a sample of data $\boldsymbol{X} = \{0,1,0,1,1 \}$ 
  * These are independent tosses of the die

* The posterior distribution of the probability of a one conditional on the data is: $$P(p_1 \mid \boldsymbol{X})$$
  
* We can determine this via Bayes theorem: $$P(p_1 \mid \boldsymbol{X}) = \frac{P(\boldsymbol{X} \mid p_1)P(p_1)}{P(\boldsymbol{X})} \propto P(\boldsymbol{X} \mid p_1)P(p_1)$$

## Defining the Likelihood Function $P(\boldsymbol{X} \mid p_1)$

The likelihood of the data given the parameter: 

$$P(\boldsymbol{X} \mid p_1) = \prod_{i=1}^N p_1^{X_i} \left(1-p_1\right)^{(1-X_i)}$$

* Any given roll of the dice $X_i$ is a Bernoulli variable $X_i \sim B(p_1)$
  * A "success" is defined by rolling a one
* The product in the likelihood function comes from each roll being independent
  * The outcome of a roll does not depend on previous or future rolls

## Visualizing the Likelihood Function

```{r likeplot, echo=FALSE}

X = c(0, 1, 0, 1, 1)
p1 = seq(.001, .999, .001)
logLike = NULL
for (p in 1:length(p1)){
  logLike = c(logLike, sum(dbinom(x = X, size = 1, prob = p1[p], log = TRUE)))
}

plot(x = p1, y = logLike, type = "l", xlab = expression("p"[1]), ylab  = expression("log( P (X |p"[1]*"))"))
```


## Choosing the Prior Distribution for $p_1$

We must now pick the prior distribution of $p_1$: 

$$P(p_1)$$
::: {.nonincremental} 
* Our choice is subjective: Many distributions to choose from
* What we know is that for a "fair" die, the probability of rolling a one is $\frac{1}{6}$
  * But...probability is not a distribution
* Instead, let's consider a Beta distribution $p_1 \sim Beta\left(\alpha, \beta\right)$
:::

## The Beta Distribution

For parameters that range between zero and one (or two finite end points), the Beta distribution makes a good choice for a prior:

$$P(p_1) = \frac{\left( p_1\right)^{\alpha-1} \left(1-p_1 \right)^{\beta1-1}}{B\left(\alpha, \beta\right)}, $$
where:

$$B\left(\alpha, \beta\right) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\alpha\right)\Gamma\left(\beta\right)}{\Gamma\left(\alpha+\beta\right)}, $$
and, 

$$\Gamma\left(z \right) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t}dt$$
## More Beta Distribution

The Beta distribution has a mean of $\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}$

* The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are called <u>hyperparameters</u>
  * Hyperparameters are parameters of prior distributions
* We can pick values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to correspond to $\frac{1}{6}$
  * Many choices: $\alpha=1$ and $\beta=5$ have the same mean as $\alpha=100$ and $\beta=500$ 
* What is the difference?
  * How strongly we feel in our beliefs...as quantified by...

## More More Beta Distribution

The Beta distribution has a variance of $\frac{\alpha\beta}{\left(\alpha+\beta \right)^2 \left(\alpha+\beta+1 \right))}$

* Choosing $\alpha=1$ and $\beta=5$ yields a prior with mean $\frac{1}{6}$ and variance $0.02$
* Choosing $\alpha=100$ and $\beta=500$ yields a prior with mean $\frac{1}{6}$ and variance $0.0002$
* The smaller prior variance means the prior is more <u>informative</u>
  * Informative priors are those that have relatively small variances
  * <u>Uninformative</u> priors are those that have relatively large variances
  
## Visualizing $P(p_1)$

```{r priorPlot, echo=FALSE}

alpha = 1
beta = 5
varBeta = (alpha*beta)/(((alpha+beta)^2)*(alpha+beta+1))

alpha2 = 100
beta2 = 500
varBeta2 = (alpha2*beta2)/(((alpha2+beta2)^2)*(alpha2+beta2+1))

p1 = seq(.001, .999, .001)
logLike = NULL
logLike2 = NULL
for (p in 1:length(p1)){
  logLike = c(logLike, sum(dbeta(x = p1[p], shape = alpha, shape2 = beta, log = FALSE)))
  logLike2 = c(logLike2, sum(dbeta(x = p1[p], shape = alpha2, shape2 = beta2, log = FALSE)))
}

matplot(x = cbind(p1, p1), y = cbind(logLike, logLike2), type = "l", xlab = expression("p"[1]), ylab  = expression("P (p"[1]*")"), lwd = 2)
legend(x = .4, y = 20, legend = c(expression(alpha*" = 1; "*beta*" = 5"), expression(alpha*" = 100; "*beta*" = 500")), col=1:2, lty=1:2, lwd=2)

```

## The Posterior Distribution

Choosing a Beta distribution for a prior for $p_1$ is *very* convenient

* When combined with Bernoulli (Binomial) data likelihood the posterior distribution can be derived analytically
* The posterior distribution is also a Beta distribution
  * $\alpha = a + \sum_{i=1}^NX_i$ ($a$ is the hyperparameter of the prior distribution)
  * $\beta = b + N - \sum_{i=1}^NX_i$ ($b$ is the hyperparameter of the posterior distribution)
* The Beta prior is said to be a <u>conjugate prior</u>: A prior distribution that leads to a posterior distribution of the same family
  * Here, prior == Beta and posterior == Beta

## Visualizing The Posterior Distribution


```{r postPlot, echo=FALSE}

a = 1 
b = 5
a2 = 100
b2 = 500

X = c(0, 1, 0, 1, 1)

p1 = seq(.001, .999, .001)
postLike1 = NULL
postLike2 = NULL
for (p in 1:length(p1)){
  postLike1 = c(postLike1, sum(dbeta(x = p1[p], shape = (a+sum(X)), shape2 = (b+length(X)-sum(X)), log = FALSE)))
  postLike2 = c(postLike2, sum(dbeta(x = p1[p], shape = (a2+sum(X)), shape2 = (b2+length(X)-sum(X)), log = FALSE)))
}

matplot(x = cbind(p1, p1), y = cbind(postLike1, postLike2), type = "l", xlab = expression("p"[1]), ylab  = expression("P (p"[1]*"|X)"), lwd = 2)
legend(x = .4, y = 20, legend = c(paste0("a = ", a, "; b = ", b), paste0("a = ", a2, "; b = ", b2)), col=1:2, lty=1:2, lwd=2)
```

## Bayesian Estimates are Summaries of the Posterior Distribution

To determine the estimate of $p_1$, we use summaries of the posterior distribution:

* With prior hyperparameters $a=1$ and $b=5$
  * $\hat{p}_1 = \frac{1+3}{1+3 +5+2} = \frac{4}{11} = .36$
  * SD = ```r sqrt(((a+3)*(b+2))/((((a+3)+(b+2))^2)*((a+3)+(b+2)+1)))```
* With prior hyperparameters $a=100$ and $b=500$
  * $\hat{p}_1 = \frac{100+3}{(100+3) + (500+2)} = \frac{103}{605} = .17$
  * SD = ```r sqrt(((a2+3)*(b2+2))/((((a2+3)+(b2+2))^2)*((a2+3)+(b2+2)+1)))```
* The standard deviation (SD) of the posterior distribution is analogous to the standard error in frequentist statistics

## Bayesian Updating

We can use the posterior distribution as a prior!

Let's roll a die to find out how...

```{r updatingInit, echo=FALSE}

# define prior distribution for a and b
priorA = 1
priorB = 5
```

```{r updating, echo=FALSE}
# rerun this section with new data to show what happens ======================

# collect new data:
newObs = 0

posteriorA = priorA + newObs
posteriorB = priorB + 1-newObs

# show plot of posterior distribution
p1 = seq(.001, .999, .001)
priorLike = NULL
postLike = NULL
for (p in 1:length(p1)){
  
  priorLike = c(priorLike, sum(dbeta(x = p1[p], shape = (priorA), shape2 = (priorB), log = FALSE)))
  postLike = c(postLike, sum(dbeta(x = p1[p], shape = (posteriorA), shape2 = (posteriorB), log = FALSE)))
}
matplot(x = cbind(p1, p1, p1), y = cbind(priorLike, postLike, originalPrior), type = "l", xlab = expression("p"[1]), ylab  = expression("P (p"[1]*"|X)"), lwd = 2,
        main = "Solid Line = Prior density; Dashed Line = Posteior Density")

# update prior with posterior
priorA = posteriorA
priorB = posteriorB

# end rerunning

```
